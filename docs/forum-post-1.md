# EchoVault — Composable Personal Context Layer for AI

Problem: AI context is siloed. Users can’t own, port, or monetize their preferences and history across apps.

Solution: EchoVault stores **encrypted personal context** as on-chain assets with **permissioned, revocable access**. Agents request access; users grant time-boxed or pay-per-read access (x402).

MVP (hackathon):
- Context NFT (cNFT/Token-2022) pointing to encrypted blob
- Access Grant PDA + Revocation registry
- Context API + Agent SDK
- x402 pay-per-read integration

Looking for:
- Solana devs familiar with PDAs / Token-2022
- x402/payment protocol collaborators
- Agent frameworks to integrate early

If this resonates, reply or DM — happy to collab.
